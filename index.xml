&lt;p&gt;*The website is mostly temporary at the moment. The blog posts will be kept, but everything else is likely to change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Welcome to the one and only Timothy Ford&amp;rsquo;s blog website! You can find my interests scattered around in four different categories found in the navigation bar at the top of the page. I feel these four different categories sum up the things I can easily talk about and share with others. They include, but aren&amp;rsquo;t limited to introspection, history and religion, nerdy stuff, and my adventures such as traveling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-introspection:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47&#34;&gt;1. Introspection&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;My life is filled with confusing and complicated problems constantly demanding to be solved. I mean whose life isn&amp;rsquo;t? Here is where I will put my reflections on life and explorations of what I do and don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy for the world to decipher through and maybe learn from. My goals and aspirations will also be found here. Find more about my feelings towards introspection and what can be found here at &lt;a href=&#34;http://imgone98.com/categories/post/introspection/introspection&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-history-religion:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47&#34;&gt;2. History/Religion&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I have a strong interest in either history or religion. However, I am intrigued by how they are related and what they can teach individuals. I believe there is more to history and religion than what is taught in primary and secondary schools and should be explored as an individual more. More on what can be found here and why I find it important can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;http://imgone98.com/categories/post/history-religion/history-religion&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-nerdy-stuff:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47&#34;&gt;3. Nerdy Stuff&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So many things can fit into this category I don&amp;rsquo;t even know where to start. I have many nerdy interests. I enjoy just about anything to do with a computer and can&amp;rsquo;t use the devilious Windows operating system without crying. Linux is always my go-to operating system and it fits my programming and electrical mind far more than the bloatware Microsoft offers. Games and game development can also be found here. To find out the full extent of my nerdiness look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://imgone98.com/categories/post/nerd/nerd&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;4-my-adventures:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47&#34;&gt;4. My Adventures&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I love the outdoors. Rain, snow, sleet, or hail I can be found outside running, hiking, biking, or just in general exploring the world. I plan to do some traveling one day and I have some very wierd, strong, and cheap views on living style that I wish to someday live. More information on my absurd living style and other outdoorsy things can be found at &lt;a href=&#34;http://imgone98.com/categories/post/adventures&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I hope my overthought introspection ramblings, random history and religious thoughts and explorations, nerdy and scholarly writings, and my crazy adventures are entertaining and worth the read. Feel free to ask questions and write comments in the comments at the bottom of the posts. Thank you so much!&lt;/p&gt;
